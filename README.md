## Getting Started

This project is my solution for this [Kata].
Since TypeScript is my go-to language, I used it to solve this problem.

### Libraries that I used
- Lodash

## How to run it

1. Make sure you have node version `>= 16.13`
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npn run build` to build the app

- `npn run start` - run program with predefined input file (`example-files/example.txt`)
- `node build/src/main.js <path-to-your-file>` - run program with your own input file
